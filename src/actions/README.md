# About this folder
This folder will hold all of your **flux** actions if you are using flux.
You can include actions into your components or stores like this:

```
let react = require('react/addons');
let MyAction = require('actions/MyAction');
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    MyAction.exampleMethod();
  }
}
```
```java
class Test{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Intellij IDEA is the best IDE in the word");
  }
}
```
